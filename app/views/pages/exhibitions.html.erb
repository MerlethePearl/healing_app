<h4>Comments from our exhibition guests:</h4>
<br>
<br>
 “This is a profound way for healthy people to gain a better understanding of what cancer patients are going through.  I can see and feel these survivors’ wide range of thoughts and emotions, from tremendous joy to painful remorse.  Thank you for this exhibition!”
<br>
“It is obvious that each survivor used the creative process to look deep within themselves to find fear, pain, anger...  Then victoriously worked through it all to embrace the courage & tenacity was there all along.  Amazing!”
<br>
“The icons in this exhibition are so heartwarmingly beautiful.  They gave me a sense of peace as we bury a dear friend tomorrow, who died from cancer after a long struggle.”
<br>
“How courageous and thought provoking!  Artistically Well Done/Beautiful and Uplifting!”
<br>
“Unable to sleep after my daughter’s first radiation treatment for her bone marrow transplant, my head spins with anger, pain, guilt and I am flooded with emotion and tears and wonder why.  This exhibition allowed me to forget about the IV’s and the chemo and the vital signs and the pain meds and the smell of the hospital and remember what it feels like to smile again.  As I stand here in the silence of this atrium, I realize my prayer shave been answered, if only for a moment.  I calm down and stare at these images.  I remember why we are here and the feelings of the hope for many tomorrows return.”

This is an exhibition created by ordinary people from all walks of life and they do not consider themselves artists.  The single thread that runs through this exhibition is they all have heard the 3 world that change a life forever “You Have Cancer”.  
You might ask why anyone would want to create from the pain and struggle that comes with cancer; much less view an exhibition about that.  We believe several things
The joys in life are lived; the pain is life is expressed.    Once pain is released, we move towards living more fully, more enlivened.
Pain is universal – no matter what the issue.  
Difficult things are hard to talk about and we need a threshold that helps us into these conversations.  These works of art do that.
<br>Art helps us understand what it is to be human.<br><br>
Hands-down!  This exhibition is not just about cancer, it is about the incredible resiliency of the human spirit.  
<br><br>
Unfortunately, everyone has been touched by cancer in some way, whether you have personally received a cancer diagnosis or have journeyed with a family member, friend, a co-worker or a neighbor.  <br><br>

Suggested Installation information
<br>
1. When unpacking a box, always note how the contents have been wrapped and placed. Keep all the original packing material to use when repacking.  Fill out condition report as you are unpacking.<br>
2. When staging two-dimensional pieces, place them upright against the wall, face-to-face and back-to-back, with separators between faces. Stack similarly sized works together. Never lay panels or framed works flat on the floor, and use rubber or non-skid pads to prevent slipping and to protect the bottom of the objects.<br>
3.  All works are wired ready to be wall mounted.  We will provide easels if you do not have a designated gallery.<br>
4. When hanging two-dimensional works, position the center of the object at standard eye level. This is generally considered to be 60"-64" from the floor.
5.  We suggest around 24” between each artwork.  The artwork can be broken up into smaller groups or units if space demands.<br>
