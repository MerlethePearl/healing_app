What about the art supplies?  Most of the art supplies are provided for you.  You might be required to bring a journal or sketchbook and a pencil and pen.

OK you are ready to leap in but you're thinking...

I am not creative: It is our birthright to be creative.  We will show you.

I can’t draw a straight line:  Good we don’t like straight lines.

I have not had any art since elementary school: Excellent we will teach you to Look.  See.  Create.

I am not in active treatment:  It doesn’t matter where you are on the cancer journey.  You will know when the time is right.

I don’t want to come alone: You are free to bring someone who is journeying with you.

But why create art from the pain and struggle that comes with cancer?   
We step outside the diagnosis and courageously create.  We get messy and dabble and play and through this our burden is lifted. Studies have shown art-making can actually be good for you.  Stress release = healthy immune system 

What are the benefits from participating in these workshops?
